### Why participate in an Octernship with APPFLOWY INC

AppFlowy is built with Flutter and Rust, an interesting tech stack with a lot of potential and opportunities. If you are a true believer in open source and want to build a world-class open source collaboration software together, we’d love to hear from you!

An Octernship with AppFlowy is aimed at creating a hands-on learning opportunity for new developers who may otherwise lack the opportunity to gain exposure to real-world software practice and entry to the technical community.

Benefits for Students:
- Students gain exposure to real-world software development and entry to the open-source community.
- Students become more competitive in the job market by having more meaningful software development experience.
- Students have hands-on opportunities to do work related to their professional interests and to further the pursuit of their interests.
- Students expand their professional network by getting involved in the community and meeting other awesome contributors.

Program Structure:

You will develop both hard and soft skills required for a software engineer in the real world throughout the program.

The program will provide you with the opportunity to:
- Collect and discuss business requirements cross-functionally
- Conduct a tech review to have your mentor and peers review your tech design doc
- Give and receive code reviews to/from your peers
- Offer help to the community
- Know your mentor and peers and participate in online hangouts
- Write an article related to your project and get it published to our newsletter - AppFlowy Binary
